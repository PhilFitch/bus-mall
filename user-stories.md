As a venture capitalist I want BusMall to have good data so their product results in more sales.

As an entrepreneur I want BusMall to have a wider appeal so that more readers pick it up, spend more time reading it, and buy more products.

As a transit rider I want something interesting to look at so that I don't have to make eye contact with strangers.
